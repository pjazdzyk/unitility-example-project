# UNITILITY Example Project - Dry air properties with functional approach

This project serves as an example to showcase the usage of the [UNITILITY](https://github.com/pjazdzyk/unitility)
library in a Java physics project. 
It demonstrates how to construct a simple project without exceptions, following a functional approach based on the VAVR library. 
This coding style aims to minimize unexpected exceptions during production and encourages developers to consistently handle potential failure scenarios.
